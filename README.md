# MongoDBFlask
This repository explains how to create a REST API using Python and host it locally using Docker. The goal of this task is to allow the user to interact with a database of products using APIs which are available on localhost via Docker.<br>
At first, E-commerce products and its information data have been hosted on a MongoDB server. Connecting to the MongoDB server and operating basic crud operation is explained in the "MongoAPI.py" file. <br>
REST API has been created with the help of flask, that allows the user to do basic CRUD operations on the data. This process is explained in "__init__.py" file.<br>
After that Dockerization of API is performed by the following command below.<br>
``` python
docker pull mongo
```
``` python
docker create -it --name MongoTest -p 5000:27017 mongo
```
``` Python
docker start MongoTest
```
``` Python
docker compose build myreader
```
``` Python
docker compose run -p 5001:5001 myreader
```
## CRUD operations

Lets operate some basic CRUD operations over the REST API.
